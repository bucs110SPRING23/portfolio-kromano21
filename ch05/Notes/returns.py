#Return Values
#How can we get a data result from our function?
#f(x) = y
#Since computers don't understand the concept of nothing, the None keyword is a value that stands in for no value at all
#None is the not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. 
#None is a data type of its own, NoneType, and the only value is None
#When functions don't have a result, the result is always None 
#Functions can only return one value. However, Python is tricky and uses tuples to fake returning more than one object
#Return Values from functions must be saved in a variable using assignment
#Return delievers a result from a function and increases a variable's scope
