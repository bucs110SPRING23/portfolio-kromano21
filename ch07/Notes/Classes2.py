#Objects are created from classes
#A class is a pure definition, so by itself it can't do anything 
#Just like a function is a blueprint for an algorithm, a class is a blueprint for a data object
#Classes are to data what functions are to algorithms 
#Type == Class
#Just like there are classes of animal and classes of cars, there are classes for data
#We've been calling them types
#To make a point object instance, we need a class that will define the Point's data
#The point class will be the blueprint for each Point on our graph
#Multiple point objects can have different x and y values, but they will all have the same x and y varaibles
#Python uses the class definition to carve our enough memory for each instance of class

#Terminology
#Instance - an object created from a class
#Instance Variable - An attribute associated with the object, the data that makes up the object
#Interface - all of the callable attributes of an object, what an object can do

#Class - Object Analogy
#One's Genetics are like an object class
#It is just the data pattern, not the data itself 
#Your experiences are the values given to your instance variables
#This is the data that defines your state at any given instanct
#Imagine a pair of identical twin siblings:
#The twins are 2 instances of the same genetic class
#Even though the twins come from the same class, they maintain a seperate state
