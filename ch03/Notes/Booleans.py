#Boolean Expressions or Logic Operations - Any operations that results true or false

# The Python Type for Storing Boolean values is called bool
# bool values: True, False
# Capitalization is important and Boolean values are not strings "True" is not equal to true
# Any object in python can be evaluated as a bool 
# False: None, 0, any empty container object
# True: anything else

#Boolean Operators
#x == y : Equality
#x !=y : not equal
#! - Bang
#x>y - x is greater than y
#x<y - y is greater than x
#x<=y
#x>=y

#Semantic Operators
#And: True and True == True
#Or: True or False == True
#Not: True == False
#In: 5 in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] == True
#Is: "hello" is "hello"
#
#String Boolean Expressions
# Equality: "Hello" == "hello" true
# "Hello" > "Goodbye" true
# compares alphabetically
# characters are kept as a number internally. You can find a letter's ordinal number
# ord("a")
# ord("A")
# chr(97) - converts integer into character equivalent (returns "a")
