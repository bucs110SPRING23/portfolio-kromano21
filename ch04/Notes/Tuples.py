#Tuples
#A tuple is just like a list, but immutable 
#Use parenthesis to define: ()
#mytuple = ('a', 'b', 'c')
#num = (5) * 4 
#What does the following expression do:
#Possibilities:
#Define a tuple containing 4 elements with a value of 5
#Set num to the value of 20 
#To create a tuple of a single element, you must include the final comma
#num = (5) * 4
#print(num)
#Single Element Tuple: (item,) - needs trailing comma
#Tuple's Special Assignment 
#Given the following 
#robot = ['johnny', 5, 1986, "S.A.I.N.T."]
#using tuples, we can assign multiple values
#name, serial, year, model = robot
#python assumes we are using a tuple, so we don't need parenthesis
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list(enumerate(mylist)))
#A mutable object, like a list, requires a lot of computational overhead
